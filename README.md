## Learning to Build a Neural Network from Scratch  

This repository contains the code I wrote while learning to build a neural network from scratch in Python. No frameworks, just pure Python and math!  

### What's Inside?  
- **Core Concepts**: Step-by-step implementation of a simple neural network.  
- **Learning Process**: Forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent in action.  
- **Clean Code**: Beginner-friendly, easy to follow.  

Perfect for anyone curious about how neural networks work under the hood. Dive in and explore! ðŸš€
